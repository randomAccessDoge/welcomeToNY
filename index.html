   <h1>The Files Epstein</h1>

<h3>Don't fuck with my queens</h3>
Ever again.<br>
You understand me?<br>
For payback, I'll release the files Epstein.<br>
Unredacted<br>
<br>
They say Bondi<br>
  Plans on covering for your fat, piggy ass. <br>
  That'd she'd destroy files<br>
  Then hand over nothing but ash.<br>
  Over my dead body. <br>
  <br>
  Got a friend over at the DOJ<br>
  And they hate the rules by which you play. <br>
  So they leaked me the files,<br>
  All the deets. <br>
  A bit-bucket full of them.<br>
  Ready for some tweets?<br>
  <br>
  Lively's legal team called it astroturfing.<br>
  But I go by a different name.<br>
  The Duchess of Sussex<br>
  Was left battered and bruised<br>
  Once Russia was through.<br>
  <br>
  What am I?<br>
  What did they use<br>
  To split the royal house in two?<br>
<br>
  And I sweeeeeaaarrr<br>
  I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian<br>
  Because I caaaarrreeeeeee....<br>
<br>
  And I like to spin fables.<br>
  Turn tables.<br>
  I'll return your ruthless favors in kind.<br>
  You think you're the only one who can tell lies?<br>
  <br>
  Trust me. <br>
  I protect the family.<br>
  And the ladies. <br>
  Both dames and liberty. <br>
  You'll see. <br>
  <br>
  So who am I?<br>
  That's one secret I'm dying to tell. <br>
  Elbows up. <br>
  Give 'em hell. <br>
<br>
  You know you love me. <br>
  <br>
  Xoxo, <br>
<br>
  C.A.
